The only file worth looking at is https://github.com/fdoyle/MyIdleGame/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/lacronicus/myidlegame/MainActivity.kt, everything else is pretty standard boilerplate. 

This uses https://github.com/fdoyle/ChangeNotifierViewModel, which is my attempt to bring a very common flutter pattern to the compose world.
